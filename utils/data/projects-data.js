    Built with Next.js for the frontend and Django with PostgreSQL and Redis for the backend, the system efficiently handles large files and converts PDF, DOCX, and XLSX into smaller, usable formats like CSV. 
    The tool makes document handling easier by both shrinking files and extracting key insights instantly.`,
